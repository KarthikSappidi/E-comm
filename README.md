# Project hosting a static E-comm Web Application Using AWS S3

# Project Overview**
- In this project, we will explore the process of hosting a static E-commerce web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Static websites are ideal for E-commerce applications that do not require server-side processing or dynamic content generation, as they offer fast performance, low cost, and simplified maintenance. By leveraging AWS services such as Amazon S3 for hosting, Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, and optionally, EC2 instances for more customization, we will create a scalable and highly available infrastructure for our E-commerce application.
